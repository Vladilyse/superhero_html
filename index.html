    <h1>Who makes a superhero?</h1>
    <h4>Superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. 
    <h4>So in order to be a superhero, you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. 
        Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. 
But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story.</h4>
<h4>If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</h4>
